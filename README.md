# Todoreact
I've been learning React.js lately, so I thought that I'd test my skills by making a todo app from scratch.

# Usage & Capabilities
There is an automatically updating progress par on top of the page. This updates as you finish tasks.

You can add headings or tasks. For a task, just type something into the input box. For headings, make sure your desired text begins with a corresponding amount of #s, Markdown-Style.
